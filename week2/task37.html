    <h1>Full-Stack</h1>
    <p>Full-stack developers have expertise in both front-end and back-end development. They are capable of handling all aspects of a web project, from designing user interfaces to managing databases and server-side logic. Full-stack development is increasingly in demand as companies seek versatile developers who can work on multiple parts of a project.</p>
    <h2>Back-End</h2>
    <p>Back-end development involves working on the server side of a website. It focuses on databases, server logic, and application programming interfaces (APIs). Back-end developers use languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java to build the backbone of a website that supports front-end functionality.</p>
